Xcode 4 Color Themes
=============

The standard color themes that come with xcode have never worked for me (sorry Apple!). If you're needing something a bit more VIM or lovely like TextMate try these. I've converted them from themes of the same name for other applications (original credit goes to those authors).

Contains themes:
* 2morrow Night
* 2morrow Night (Eighties)
* Coal Graal
* Glitterbomb
* Kellys
* Monokai
* Night
* Resesif
* Sidewalk Chalk

Installation
-----------

Place the 
	~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes
folder of your home directory.

Usage
-----

Select the theme from the prefences menu of Xcode.
