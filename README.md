Xcode 4 Color Themes
=============

The standard color themes that come with xcode have never worked for me (sorry Apple!). If you're needing something a bit more VIM or lovely like TextMate try these. I've converted them from themes of the same name for other applications (original credit goes to those authors).

Contains themes:

* 2morrow Night
* 2morrow Night (Eighties)
* Basic
* Coal Graal
* Glitterbomb
* Kellys
* Monokai
* Night
* Resesif
* Sidewalk Chalk
* Sunset

Installation
-----------

Place .dvtcolorthemes in

	~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes

or clone this repository into

	~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/

and rename it to

	FontAndColorThemes

Usage
-----

Select the theme from the prefences menu of Xcode.
The font I use is Envy Code R, available [here][http://damieng.com/creative/typography]
